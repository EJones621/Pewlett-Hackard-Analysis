# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to help out Pewlett Hackard's employee structure. First, identifying the number of retiring employees per title, and secondly, the employees who are eligible for the company's mentorship program. There is a large number of senior employees who are retiring within the next couple years so it's important to figure it out ahead of time to be prepared.
