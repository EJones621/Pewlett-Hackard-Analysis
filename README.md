# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7: Employee Database with SQL

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to help out Pewlett Hackard's employee structure. First, identifying the number of retiring employees per title, and secondly, the employees who are eligible for the company's mentorship program. There is a large number of senior employees who are retiring within the next couple years so it's important to figure it out ahead of time to be prepared.

## Results
The following are four major points from the project:
* There are a total of 90,398 employees at Pewlett Hackard who were born between 1952 to 1955 that are expected to retire soon.
* There are seven different titles that are affected by employees retiring. Below is a table broken down into how employees are expected to retire soon within each job title:

The two that are more heavily impacted are Senior Engineers and Senior Staff employees. They make up roughly 64% of the number of employees expected to retire.

* There are 1,549 current Pewlett Hackard employees (born in 1965) who are eligible for the mentorship program that would help replace the 90,398 employees. Which would mean each mentor would have roughly 58 to mentor. (90,398 / 1,549 = 58.36)
